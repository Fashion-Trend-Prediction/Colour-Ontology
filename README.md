<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Colour is an important visual cue in fashion. Currently, computer vision is being applied to fashion much more than before. The lack
of a consistent, comprehensive vocabulary and relevant relationships to capture expert knowledge in fashion colour can severely hamper the work
of computer researchers, thus hindering the development of fashion trend prediction. In this study, we propose an ontology that maps colour more
closely to how they are viewed and used in the fashion world. Following W3C Semantic Web standards, it captures relevant concepts of colour in
the fashion industry, including the basic vocabulary of colours with its classifications, attributes, and important relationships.
